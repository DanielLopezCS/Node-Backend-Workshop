# BriskPoller
A project that connects to a local postgresql database as well as a redis cache client in order to test the speed increase on a medium sized database. The frontend was created with react and material ui and displays response times using bars.This was most created for boilerplate reasons for my future projects where ill use these along with PM2 / worker threads to try and build a scalable backend server capable of handling several requests in an efficient way. If cloned the postgresql url link will need to be changed and the example database used can be found here:
